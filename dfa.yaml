# DFA recognizing { x in {0,1}* | x does not end in 000 }
# YAML syntax allows lists in JSON syntax such as [q, q0, q00]
# but also with dashes on separate lines as states is specified below.

states: 
  - q      # last bit was a 1 or non-existent
  - q0     # last two bits were 10
  - q00    # last three bits were 100
  - q000   # last three bits were 000

alphabet: [0, 1]

# no last bit when we start
initial_state: q

# accept if last three bits were not 000
accepting_states: [q, q0, q00]

# if we see a 0, move closer to state q000
# if we see a 1, reset back to state q
transitions:
  q:
    0: q0    # if we see a 0, count one more 0 than before
    1: q     # YAML requires a space after the colon
  q0:
    0: q00   # one more 0
    1: q
  q00:
    0: q000  # one more 0
    1: q
  q000:
    0: q000  # until we get to three, then stay here until we see a 1
    1: q
